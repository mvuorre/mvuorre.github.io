  abstract = {Appropriately centering Level 1 predictors is vital to the interpretation of intercept and slope parameters in multilevel models (MLMs). The issue of centering has been discussed in the literature, but it is still widely misunderstood. The purpose of this article is to provide a detailed overview of grand mean centering and group mean centering in the context of 2-level MLMs. The authors begin with a basic overview of centering and explore the differences between grand and group mean centering in the context of some prototypical research questions. Empirical analyses of artificial data sets are used to illustrate key points throughout. The article provides a number of practical recommendations designed to facilitate centering decisions in MLM applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Technological advances have led to an increase in intensive longitudinal data and the statistical literature on modeling such data is rapidly expanding, as are software capabilities. Common methods in this area are related to time-series analysis, a framework that historically has received little exposure in psychology. There is a scarcity of psychology-based resources introducing the basic ideas of time-series analysis, especially for data sets featuring multiple people. We begin with basics of N Ï­ 1 time-series analysis and build up to complex dynamic structural equation models available in the newest release of Mplus Version 8. The goal is to provide readers with a basic conceptual understanding of common models, template code, and result interpretation. We provide short descriptions of some advanced issues, but our main priority is to supply readers with a solid knowledge base so that the more advanced literature on the topic is more readily digestible to a larger group of researchers.},
