	shorttitle = {Doing Bayesian Data Analysis},
	abstract = {There is an explosion of interest in Bayesian statistics, primarily because recently created computational methods have finally made Bayesian analysis obtainable to a wide audience. Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, A Tutorial Introduction with R and {BUGS}, provides an accessible approach to Bayesian Data Analysis, as material is explained clearly with concrete examples. The book begins with the basics, including essential concepts of probability and random sampling, and gradually progresses to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for realistic data. The text delivers comprehensive coverage of all scenarios addressed by non-Bayesian textbooks- t-tests, analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) and comparisons in {ANOVA}, multiple regression, and chi-square (contingency table analysis). This book is intended for first year graduate students or advanced undergraduates. It provides a bridge between undergraduate training and modern Bayesian methods for data analysis, which is becoming the accepted research standard. Prerequisite is knowledge of algebra and basic calculus. Free software now includes programs in {JAGS}, which runs on Macintosh, Linux, and Windows. Author website: http://www.indiana.edu/{\textasciitilde}kruschke/{DoingBayesianDataAnalysis}/Provides complete examples with R programming language and {BUGS} software (both Freeware)  Addresses topics such as experiment planning, power analysis and sample size planning Includes numerous exercises with explicit purposes and guidelines for accomplishment.},

	isbn = {978-1-4398-4095-5},
	abstract = {Now in its third edition, this classic book is widely considered the leading text on Bayesian methods, lauded for its accessible, practical approach to analyzing data and solving research problems. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition continues to take an applied approach to analysis using up-to-date Bayesian methods. The authors—all leaders in the statistics community—introduce basic concepts from a data-analytic perspective before presenting advanced methods. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples drawn from real applications and research emphasize the use of Bayesian inference in practice. New to the Third Edition   Four new chapters on nonparametric modeling Coverage of weakly informative priors and boundary-avoiding priors Updated discussion of cross-validation and predictive information criteria Improved convergence monitoring and effective sample size calculations for iterative simulation Presentations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational Bayes, and expectation propagation New and revised software code   The book can be used in three different ways. For undergraduate students, it introduces Bayesian inference starting from first principles. For graduate students, the text presents effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields. For researchers, it provides an assortment of Bayesian methods in applied statistics. Additional materials, including data sets used in the examples, solutions to selected exercises, and software instructions, are available on the book’s web page.},

	shorttitle = {Intensive Longitudinal Methods},
	abstract = {A complete, practical guide to planning and executing an intensive longitudinal study, this book provides the tools for understanding within-subject social, psychological, and physiological processes in everyday contexts. Intensive longitudinal studies involve many repeated measurements taken on individuals, dyads, or groups, and include diary and experience sampling studies. A range of engaging, worked-through research examples with datasets are featured. Coverage includes how to: select the best intensive longitudinal design for a particular research question, model within-subject change processes for continuous and categorical outcomes, distinguish within-subject from between-subjects effects, assess the reliability of within-subject changes, assure sufficient statistical power, and more. Several end-of-chapter write-ups illustrate effective ways to present study findings for publication. Datasets and output for the examples are available for readers' use at the companion website. The website also includes {HLM}, {MLwin}, and R code as an alternative to the {SPSS}, {SAS}, and Mplus code presented in the book.},

	shorttitle = {Statistical Rethinking},
	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers’ knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today’s model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both {PhD} students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web {ResourceThe} book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s website and {GitHub}. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},
