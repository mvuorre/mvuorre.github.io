  abstract = {Paul Feyerabend (1924--1994) initially made a name for himself inthe foundations of quantum theory and as an ardent supporter of KarlPopper's critical rationalism. He argued that good scienceshould be an attempt to re-interpret experience according to our bestscientific theories, which should be used to correct common knowledgeand everyday language to promote progress. His early work resultedfrom a critical synthesis of Popper's views on empiricism withWittgenstein's insights on meaning. Specifically, Feyerabendcombined Popper's views on testability with Wittgenstein'sinsight that theories determine the meanings of observation sentencesso that the same observation sentences make incompatible observationstatements, depending on which theory is used to interpret them.Feyerabend used these peculiar views to criticize his interpretationof Popper's empiricism (`falsificationism') fromwithin Popper's broader philosophical framework (`criticalrationalism'). According to Feyerabend, Popper'sempiricism has a limited validity. It is limited to testingcommensurable theories because it relies on formal relations betweencorresponding predictions deduced from incompatible rivals. Bycontrast, meaning change through scientific revolution renders rivalworldviews, as realistic interpretations of experience, logicallydisjoint (or `incommensurable'). Feyerabend proposed ageneral model for testing incommensurable rivals based on conjecturesand novel, theory-laden corroborations as exemplified by the Brownianmotion example. Feyerabend was arguing for theoretical pluralism, andmore tolerance toward new proposals, especially toward new approachesin the foundations of quantum theory, such as David Bohm's`hidden variables'.},

  abstract = {This article is designed to concisely teach undergraduate and new graduate students lessons in reading and writing I have learned in my past two decades as a university student, teacher, and researcher (including through publishing, retracting, correcting, and republishing articles in outlets with varying levels of ``impact'' and publication fees). Don't just start at the beginning of an academic article/book and try to read straight to the end! Instead, I recommend starting by reading the title(s)/author(s) and abstract(s), then the figures, reading the Discussion section, and skimming/spot-checking the references, peer reviews, and data (e.g., spreadsheets, audiovisual stimuli, surveys), if available. Only once you have done this and evaluated whether it seems worth your time do I recommend deciding whether to read every word of some/all sections/chapters (and any accompanying supplementary material) or digging deeper into reanalysing/ replicating the data. I recommend writing accordingly so that most of your key information will be conveyed even if your reader only gets through your title, abstract, and figures. I discuss various strategies to improve your own academic reading/writing and the broader culture of academia, from practical (e.g., formatting and tracking references and citations using Zotero and Google Scholar, asking constructive questions rather than self-promoting comments, publishing using Peer Community In Registered Reports) to philosophical (e.g., ethical issues in authorship, citation, AI, publishing, and funding). I explain the intended goals of academic research (to create and distribute valuable new knowledge) and perverse incentives that lead us astray from these goals (e.g., chasing prestige and funding). I conclude by posing the open question of if and how we should dismantle the current extortionary academic-industrial complex and re-design it to align with its intended goals.},

As this methodological reform expresses itself in psychological research, peer reviewers of such work must also adapt their practices to remain relevant. Reviewers of journal submissions wield considerable power to promote methodological reform, and thereby contribute to the advancement of a more robust psychological literature. We describe concrete practices that reviewers can use to encourage transparency, intellectual humility, and more valid assessments of the methods and statistics reported in articles.},

In this Tutorial, we explain how version control systems, such as the popular Git program, support these functions and then show how to use Git with a graphical interface in the RStudio program. This Tutorial is written for researchers with no previous experience using version control systems and covers both single-user and collaborative workflows. The online Supplemental Material provides information on advanced Git command-line functions. Git presents an elegant solution to specific challenges to curating, sharing, and collaborating on research assets and can be implemented in common workflows with little extra effort.},

  abstract = {Psychology's replication crisis is typically conceptualized as the insight that the published literature contains a worrying amount of unreplicable, false-positive findings. At the same time, meta-scientific attempts to assess the crisis in more detail have reported substantial difficulties in identifying unambiguous definitions of the scientific claims in published articles and determining how they are connected to the presented evidence. I argue that most claims in the literature are so critically underspecified that attempts to empirically evaluate them are doomed to failure---they are not even wrong. Meta-scientists should beware of the flawed assumption that the psychological literature is a collection of well-defined claims. To move beyond the crisis, psychologists must reconsider and rebuild the conceptual basis of their hypotheses before trying to test them.},
