My research focuses on psychological functioning in the context of digital technologies and environments. Much of my recent work has focused on the roles that digital technologies---particularly video games---play in individuals' well-being. In my work, I apply statistical methods to large-scale datasets and conduct controlled experiments. I also place great emphasis on the transparency and reproducibility of all my work. For more information, you can take a look at my [vita](https://github.com/mvuorre/CV/raw/main/vuorre-matti.pdf), check out my Tilburg profile [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/m-j-vuorre/), or browse this website.

In addition to my current research topics, I have written about [metacognition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11409-020-09257-1), methodology (e.g. [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918754826)), and applied statistics ([e.g. here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642850.2018.1428102)) within the psychological sciences. I also run a sporadic [blog](blog.html) about statistics, psychology, science and R.

## Integrity statement

Academic research is a service conducted in the public interest without biases or hidden agendas. I aim to do so and conduct my work in accordance with [The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/) and its four main principles: Reliability, Honesty, Respect, and Accountability.

I list all the sources of my research funding in [my CV](https://github.com/mvuorre/CV/raw/main/vuorre-matti.pdf), and all my current external positions on my [employer's website](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/m-j-vuorre). My work is or has been funded by Tilburg University, the Huo Family Foundation, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the University of Oxford's John Fell Fund. I have received honoraria (or similar) for services relating to research and education from the European Commission, University of ZÃ¼rich, University of Aberdeen, and the University of Basel. I have provided in-kind consultations and served as a non-paid panel member for Meta and K-Games.
