When you browse to an academic journal article's website, for example [this one](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918770963)[^1], if you are lucky and the manuscript is not [paywalled](https://astro.theoj.org/post/168-), you can read the HTML version of the article which usually looks something like the one shown in @fig-page.

Vintage technophiles like myself still prefer reading (and archiving) the manuscript's PDF version. But these publishers are smart and have implemented new [~~data-harvesting~~](https://doi.org/10.4000/proceedings.elpub.2018.30) accessibility features such as "fancy online PDF readers". So when you click on the PDF/EPUB link on the page, instead of just getting the PDF, you see @fig-epdf instead.

This bugs me: I just want the PDF and every additional click and UI idiosynchracy adds friction to my daily work. So I did what any reasonable person would do and wrote a little [Firefox extension](https://github.com/mvuorre/pdf-direct) that skips journals' "enhanced" PDF viewers to direct PDF downloads. You can get it here: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdf-direct/>. After installing PDF-Direct, clicking on the PDF/EPUB link will immediately just download the darn PDF (@fig-pdf).

An additional problem with these "fancy online PDF readers" is that they seem to break [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)'s ability to download PDF files, though I am not sure if that is the reason. I'm quite busy and don't actually know/care about how these Firefox extensions work: PDF-direct is 99% vibe-coded but seems to work well. It is also simple enough that I am able to see that it probably doesn't have any real security implications. I might be wrong though, so send your reports to <https://github.com/mvuorre/pdf-direct>.

[^1]: Goes without saying that this particular (quite nice) article has nothing to do with the topic of this post, I just happened to be reading it and since it was open access I was able to show how this works in practice.
