I am a Finn living in the Netherlands. I work at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/m-j-vuorre). Prior to moving to the Netherlands, I studied Psychology and Philosophy in Wellington, New Zealand, at the [Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/) Kelburn campus from 2008 to 2013. The hobbits were right, Aotearoa is a wonderful place, and I never really left. 

I then completed a PhD in Psychology at Columbia University in New York City in the spring of 2018. My PhD "*[Using Visual Illusions to Examine Action-Related Perceptual Changes](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8W39CRZ)*" concerned cognitive and perceptual psychology, and examined how volition might distort perception. In New York, I was very busy eating bagels and Trader Joe's "Everything but the bagel" seasoning^[Thanks Andy!]. After finishing my PhD, I remained at Columbia as a [post-doc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) for a while.

I moved from NYC to Oxford in 2020, where I worked again as a post-doc. In 2023 I moved to the Netherlands and am now an Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.

When I've some free time, I like hiking, making photographs, rock climbing (mostly crushing V2 problems on plastic---beast mode!), spending time with my family, badminton, eating Korean food, and playing with computers. I'm not very good at any of those things, but hey, life is all about learning. 

My favorite websites are [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and [Gelman's blog](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) and my favorite TV show is [Sunny](https://itsalwayssunny.fandom.com/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_Wiki).
