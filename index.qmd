I am a researcher at Tilburg University, where I study psychological functioning in the context of digital technologies and online/virtual environments. Much of my most recent research has focused on the roles that digital technologies---particularly video games---play in individuals' well-being. In my work, I apply statistical methods to large-scale datasets and conduct controlled experiments. I also place great emphasis on the transparency and reproduciblity of all my work. For more details, you can take a look at my [vita](https://github.com/mvuorre/CV/raw/main/vuorre-matti.pdf). You can also check out my Tilburg profile [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/m-j-vuorre/).

In addition to my current research topics, I have written about [meta-cognition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11409-020-09257-1) and have a keen interest in methodology (e.g. [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918754826)) and applied statistics ([here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642850.2018.1428102)) within the psychological sciences. I run a very sporadic [blog](blog.html) about statistics, psychology, science and the wonderful R statistical programming environment, and [another blog](https://matti.bearblog.dev/) for rants that probably shouldn't be online.

## Integrity statement

Academic research is a service conducted in the public interest without biases or hidden agendas. I aim to do so and conduct my work in accordance with [The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/) and its four main principles: Reliability, Honesty, Respect, and Accountability.

I list all the sources of my research funding in [my CV](https://github.com/mvuorre/CV/raw/main/vuorre-matti.pdf), and all my external (to academic institutions) positions on my Tilburg University [profile page](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/matti-vuorre). My work is or has been funded in the past by Tilburg University, the Economic and Social Research Council, and the University of Oxford's John Fell Fund. I have provided in-kind consultations and served as a non-paid panel member for [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) and [K-Games](http://www.kgames.or.kr/introduction/greetings-eng/).
