Like many people in academia, I spend much of my working time in front of computers. It's then important to me that everything is *just* the way I want it, software is easily available and updated, and that my terminal looks nice :mage:.

This blog post is an adaptation of a document that I've saved for myself in the eventual case that I have to wipe my computer and reinstall everything, or if I get a new computer. I use Macs, but some of these things also work on Linux. Nothing here will work for Windows machines.

# MacOS setup

This aims to be succinct and quick, using homebrew to install as much as possible from the command line.

## Software

Fire up the terminal and install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). The command is currently

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

but I would check the website before running that. Then install some stuff. First the GUI stuff that I use:

```bash
# GUI apps
brew install --cask \
  firefox iterm2 microsoft-office \
  zotero obsidian todoist sublime-text \
  mactex rectangle alfred slack zoom \
  visual-studio-code docker monitorcontrol
```

Then the terminal and command line things that I like to use:

```bash
# Terminal and CLI things
brew install \
  tailscale starship bat \
  btop lsd dua syncthing
```
And then a bunch of fonts. There's probably more now but I've forgotten. The more the merrier :smile:.

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install svn
brew install --cask \
  font-fantasque-sans-mono font-fantasque-sans-mono-nerd-font \
  font-noto-sans font-noto-serif font-noto-mono font-noto-mono-for-powerline \
  font-noto-emoji font-hasklug-nerd-font font-anonymice-nerd-font \
  font-meslo-lg-nerd-font font-fira-code font-fira-mono font-fira-sans \
  font-fira-sans-condensed font-pt-mono font-pt-sans font-pt-sans-narrow \
  font-pt-serif font-pt-sans-caption font-pt-serif-caption
```

## Terminal

I then set up my terminal environment. I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) and the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt. I also pick up some nice iTerm2 color themes from <https://iterm2colorschemes.com/>. 

Now I can open up VS Code in the current working directory with `code .`, or get nice outputs when listing working directory contents (I've aliased `l` to `lsd -la` in `~/.zshrc`):

## R

Then onto the serious stuff :gem:

- I install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) because I (sometimes) want to use specific versions. Also I need to remember to get the appropriate M1 version more often :smile:.

- RStudio: I use the [daily development version](https://dailies.rstudio.com/) of RStudio. I don't install this with homebrew because it sometimes has issues with using the right R version.

- I also used to make sure that I'm using the faster Apple provided [BLAS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Which-BLAS-is-used-and-how-can-it-be-changed_003f) (20x faster for some operations). I can't remember if I've done that this time though and am now afraid to check. 

I then immediately open RStudio and install my "base" packages that I use all the time.

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install(
  c(
    "usethis", "tidyverse", "brms", 
    "kableExtra", "janitor", "here", 
    "scales", "gtsummary", "multidplyr", 
    "ggtext", "parameters", "tidybayes", 
    "ggstance", "ggdist", "patchwork", 
    "ggforce", "ggh4x", "lavaan", 
    "emmeans", "ggstance", "renv", 
    "furrr", "remotes", "kableExtra",
    "gt"
  )
)
```

## Utilities

I use [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) to make sure my computer never sleeps (unless I tell it to.) Amphetamine is not available on homebrew.

### Zotero

I love Zotero, and it has some stellar plugins:

- Install the Zotero SciHub add-on so I can access papers <https://github.com/ethanwillis/zotero-scihub>
- Better BibTex <https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/>
  - This will automatically help manage bibtex keys
  - Possible to live-update a .bib file for e.g. syncing to somewhere
- Zutilo <https://github.com/wshanks/Zutilo>, but I can't now remember what it even does
- ZotFile
  - Point Zotero to my pdfs on ~/Sync/ZoteroPDF (Syncthing directory)
  - check change to lower case, replace blanks, max length 60 in zotfile settings
- Use <https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-storage-scanner> to e.g. get rid of broken attachments

## General Things

I then turn on Dock hiding in Mac settings. Have I told you that the Ventura update totally destroyed the Settings menu, and I am now seriously considering switching to Linux? Well I did now. I also rename the computer to something dumb in System settings > Sharing > Computer Name.

## Dotfiles and configuration files

I also have a git repo with some dotfiles and configurations I use, but it's currently private. It mainly creates some terminal aliases and theme options, and git global configurations. I just backup existing files and copy from the repo to wherever they need to be, but there are more complicated workflows too.

# Conclusion

After this I usually have a pretty useful computer. Because of homebrew its quite fast too.
