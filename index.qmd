I am a scientist at Tilburg University, where I study psychological functioning in the context of digital technologies and online/virtual environments. Much of my most recent research has focused on the roles that digital technologies---particularly video games---play in individuals' well-being. In my work, I apply statistical methods to large-scale datasets and conduct controlled experiments. I also place great emphasis on the transparency and reproduciblity of all my work. For more details, you can take a look at my [vita](https://github.com/mvuorre/CV/raw/main/vuorre-matti.pdf). You can also check out my Tilburg profile [here](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/m-j-vuorre/).

In addition to my current research topics, I have written about [meta-cognition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11409-020-09257-1) and have a keen interest in methodology (e.g. [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918754826)) and applied statistics ([here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21642850.2018.1428102)) within the psychological sciences. I run a very sporadic [blog](blog.html) about statistics, psychology, science and the wonderful R statistical programming environment, and [another blog](https://matti.bearblog.dev/) for rants that probably shouldn't be online.

## Selected writings

Here are some recent works that I was particularly happy to have contributed to. (Unlike children, you *can* have favorite papers.)

- "*An intensive longitudinal dataset of in-game player behaviour and well-being in PowerWash Simulator*" ([web](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02530-3) \| [pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02530-3.pdf) \| [code & data](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WPEH6))

- "*Time spent playing video games is unlikely to impact well-being.*" ([web](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.220411) \| [pdf](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.220411?download=true) \| [code & data](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/373533911))

I believe scientific communication should be available to all, so all these papers are openly available. If you find a paper of mine that you'd be interested in reading, and which somehow isn't available online, let me know and I'll fix it ASAP. In the future, we'll figure out a way to get rid of publishers entirely.
