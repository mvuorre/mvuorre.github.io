## tl;dr

My version of the [Citation Picker for Zotero](https://github.com/mvuorre/vscode-zotero/releases/tag/v0.2.0) VS Code (and Positron, etc) extension allows inserting references from Zotero to source documents and their .bib files. Here is what using it in [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) looks like:

## What?

We like writing all our scientific outputs with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/front-matter.html) using the [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) IDE. We also manage our references/library with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), and want to insert references directly from Zotero to the Quarto documents. What does that mean?

It means that you fire up Positron, write a document like `manuscript.qmd`:

title: Science!
author: Matti Vuorre

bibliography: bibliography.bib

Probability theory is cool [@jaynesProbabilityTheoryLogic2003].
````

and then run `quarto render manuscript.qmd` in your terminal. By default this creates a HTML document (but can be a PDF, Word document, or whatever) that will look like this:

Notice how the Jaynes reference is nicely dealt with both in-text and in the references section. While Positron allows easily adding citations from Zotero when editing documents in [visual mode](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/positron/visual-editor.html#zotero-citations), this was less easy in source mode (which I much prefer).

## How?

The [vscode-zotero](https://github.com/mblode/vscode-zotero) extension makes it easy to add in-text references to Quarto documents, and can be installed through Positron's "Extensions" panel:

Critically, the extension does not add the entry in the document's associated .bib file (`bibliography: bibliography.bib` in the document's YAML front matter.)

## How? An improved answer

So what I did was fork the extension, add this functionality, and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/mblode/vscode-zotero/pull/38). So once/if the pull request is merged you can install it as above. For now, to install the extension, go to <https://github.com/mvuorre/vscode-zotero/releases/tag/v0.2.0> and download the `.vsix` file.

Then, in Positron, install the extension by clicking "Install from VSIX..." and select the downloaded `.vsix` file.

Restart Positron, ensure Zotero is running and that you have installed the [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) Zotero plugin. Then, in Positron, open up your source document and ensure its frontmatter contains a reference to a [bibliography file](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html). Then place your cursor where you want the citation to appear in your document, and launch the extension's citation picker function. On a Mac the hotkey for launching the function is <kbd>Shift+Option+Z</kbd> and Windows probably has one too. This brings up the citation picker UI dialog:

Typing anything in the dialog will search for items with that string, and advanced search queries like `author:jaynes` and `author:jaynes theory` work as well. Once you've chosen the desired citation, hit <kbd>Return</kbd> and the in-text citation is added to the document, and its biblatex entry is written to the document's associated `.bib` file.

Done and done.
