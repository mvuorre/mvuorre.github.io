## Sometimes I R

This is my blog on psychology, statistics, data science, and---most of all---how to apply R in those fields. The source code is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) blog project, and is currently hosted here at <https://github.com/mvuorre/mvuorre.github.io>. 

**To read this blog, head over to <https://sometimesir.com>**. I use Netlify to serve the `docs` directory (the target directory for Quarto) and DNS, and Porkbun for the domain. For historical reasons, this blog is also accessible at <https://mvuorre.github.io>, but please use the former URL for linking etc. Link rot is real, everyone!

I try hard to make all the R code here reproducible, so don't hesitate to open an issue if you find problems.
