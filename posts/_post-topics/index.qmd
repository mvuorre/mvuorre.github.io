# R and Quarto in VS Code

I've been using R, and it's extensions R Markdown, Quarto, bookdown, etc, exclusively through R Studio for nearly a decade. (Holy ðŸ’©.) R Studio is great, it's optimized for producing content with R, and the folks behind it develop amazing software to support the R coding experience.

However, with the recent launch of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), I think things are going to change. Quarto is a cross-language cross-IDE technical publishing system, and as such the R Studio functions supporting things like R Markdown will be less important. Also, VS Code is a hugely more popular IDE with a massive community around it. It is far superior to R Studio when working with other languages, such as LaTeX, Markdown, and Finnish, all of which I use fairly often. Switching to VS Code would allow me to use only one editor across all my projects, and offer a generally smoother coding / writing experience.

Frequentism is about decisions, probability is.

Frequentist decide a priori.

Bayesians are empirical and use information.
