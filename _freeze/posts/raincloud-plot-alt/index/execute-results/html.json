But. I am concerned that they might unnecessarily duplicate features of the data, which might lead to visually overwhelming presentations, and therefore degrade the signal to noise ratio of the plots.\n\nIt just might be possible to show these three features---raw data, summary, and densities---in a visually simpler and perhaps more compelling way. In this blog entry, I'll try two variations on this theme that I hope simplify the presentation without taking information away.\n\n# Raincloud plots the hard way\n\nBut first, I'll try to recreate this raincloud plot without the ggrain package. Most of the geoms and stats we need are in the [ggdist](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html) package [@ggdist]. The end result (@fig-ggdistrain-1) looks very similar to the ggrain version, above.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggdist)\niris %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = .033)) +\n  geom_boxplot(position = position_nudge(x = -0.085), width = .05) +\n  stat_halfeye(\n    side = \"left\", \n    normalize = \"none\",\n    width = .3,\n    position = position_nudge(x = -0.15), \n    point_interval = NULL\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A raincloud plot made using 'base' ggplot2 and ggdist.](index_files/figure-html/fig-ggdistrain-1-1.png){#fig-ggdistrain-1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOK, so now we have a handle on how to create raincloud plots \"manually\".\n\n# Removing summaries and densities\n\nWhat I would like to do next is to make the summaries less prominent. I can use `stat_halfeye()`. Above, I used `stat_halfeye(..., point_inteval = NULL)` to remove them completely. Here, I will specify some quantiles to show with the `width` argument. I am not sure if @fig-ggdistrain-2 is an improvement.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\niris %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = .033)) +\n  stat_halfeye(\n    side = \"left\", \n    normalize = \"none\",\n    width = .3,\n    position = position_nudge(x = -0.1),\n    .width = c(.5, .99)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A raincloud plot made using 'base' ggplot2 and ggdist, with different summary geoms (a point interval).](index_files/figure-html/fig-ggdistrain-2-1.png){#fig-ggdistrain-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMaybe all this information can be gleaned from the points alone. To do this, we can jitter the points according to a method specified in the [vipor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vipor/index.html) package [@vipor]. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nset.seed(1)\niris %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Species, Sepal.Length, fill = Species, col = Species)) +\n  geom_point(\n    position = position_quasirandom(width = .1)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A scatterplot where the points are jittered on the x-axis according to a normal density kernel.](index_files/figure-html/fig-rain-bee-1.png){#fig-rain-bee width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-rain-bee arranges the points using one of the offsetting algorithms in vipor, brought to ggplot via the [ggbeeswarm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggbeeswarm/index.html) package [@ggbeeswarm]. By default, this is the \"quasirandom\" method, where \"points are distributed within a kernel density estimate of the distribution with offset determined by quasirandom Van der Corput noise\". I can only guess that \"the distribution\" refers to a gaussian distribution.\n\nIt would be really nice if we could choose the x-axis side to which jitter the points. Then we could display two groups side by side. Unfortunately that is not possible.\n\n# A more complicated example\n\n![A more complicated raincloud plot courtesy of Rogier Kievit](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/109/460/641/893/080/595/small/0f1dcd129a6b60a5.png){#fig-new-ggrain}\n\nLet's try a more complicated example similar to Rogier Kievit's figure (@fig-new-ggrain). I first simulate some data with two groups and four timepoints. There's also some covariate that I'd like to display.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data generation\ngenerate_data <- function(seed = NA, n = 200) {\n  if (!is.na(seed)) set.seed(seed)\n  dat <- tibble(\n    id = 1:n,\n    x = sample(0:1, n, replace = TRUE),\n    c = rnorm(n),\n    `1` = rnorm(n, x*.2 + c*.4, 1.1),\n    `2` = rnorm(n, x*.2 + c*.4, 1.2),\n    `3` = rnorm(n, x*.2 + c*.4, 1.3),\n    `4` = rnorm(n, x*.2 + c*.4, 1.4)\n  ) %>% \n    mutate(x = factor(x, labels = c(\"Old\", \"Young\"))) %>% \n    pivot_longer(`1`:`4`) %>% \n    mutate(name = as.integer(name))\n}\ndat <- generate_data(9)\n```\n:::\n\n\nI'll try to show this plot with much fewer visual symbols, and hopefully retain most of the information. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\ndat %>% \n  rename(Time = name, Value = value) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Time, Value)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(\n    \"Covariate\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(col = c, group = x),\n    size = 1, alpha = .75,\n    position = position_quasirandom(width = .05, dodge.width = .35)\n  ) +\n  new_scale_color() +\n  scale_color_brewer(\n    \"Group\",\n    palette = \"Set1\"\n  ) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(color = x),\n    interval_size_range = c(.3, .9),\n    position = position_dodge(.075)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An attempt at a more complicated \"raincloud\" plot using ggnewscale and ggdist.](index_files/figure-html/fig-ggdistrain-new-1.png){#fig-ggdistrain-new width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHmm. @fig-ggdistrain-new doesn't quite work visually as I'd like it to. I think it would be really nice if the jittered points were jittered only on their respective sides.\n\nI might come back to this later to see if I can improve on this design.\n\nThe takeaway, though, is that the ggrain package provides really nice figures out of the box. If we want to do more complex figures kind of like these, the ggdist and ggbeeswarm plots can create compelling alternatives.\n",
